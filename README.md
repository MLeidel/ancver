## Web Anchor Verifier

### Ahoy Raspberry Pythonistas

__Problem:__  
I have a webpage with over 50 links to other websites.
How can I periodically verify that each URL still points
to a valid website domain and entry point?

__Solution 1:__  
Click on each link and see what happens.  
_Outcome:_ Works but takes a long time to do.

__Solution 2:__  
Use "Anchor Verifier" a small python program.  
_Outcome:_ Works and is much faster than Solution 1.

__The Program__:  
```python
'''
anchor verify
USE: python3 anchor.py URL print|try|open|
print : report request status to console
try : report status to console and launch error URLs in browser
open : launch all URLs in browser

Anchor tags must be marked with 'scan'. Example:
    <a scan href='https://somedomain.com'>Some Domain</a>

errs = 0  # to count errors


if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print("Missing args: URL print|open")
    sys.exit(1)

r = requests.get(sys.argv[1], timeout=(4,5))  # loads the page with the links to be tested
print(r.status_code)
data = r.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')

anchor_tags = soup.find_all('a', attrs={'scan': True})  # locate anchor tags with "scan" attribute

action = sys.argv[2].lower()  # print, try, or open

# Process the list of URLs
for url in urls:
    if errs > 30:
        print("Too many errors!")
        sys.exit(1)

    if url.startswith("http"):

            webbrowser.open(url)

            try:
                r = requests.head(url, timeout=(4,11))  # using 'head', faster than 'get'
            except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
                cprint("Request Timed Out, try URL in browser", 'red', attrs=['bold',])
                errs += 1
                if action == "try":
                    webbrowser.open(url)

                errs += 1
                if action == "try":
                    webbrowser.open(url)
            else:
                error_msg = err.get(r.status_code, " OK")
                # Many status codes other than 200 will occur
                # because of website security and the fact that
                # our requests are not made from a browser!
                # So these are assumed to be OK and they'll
                # be printed out with the code and message.
                print(r.status_code, error_msg)

print(f"\nFound {errs} errors.")

__Discussion:__  

This little program has value for several reasons. 
First, it will solve our problem discussed above, allowing us to rapidly 
verify each anchor tag that we choose to review. Secondly, this program
demonstrates how to use three very useful Python libraries related to 
Internet access from your desktop.

Some forethought is required in that when you create your anchor tags you will
need to include one more attribute into each anchor you want to check with
the anchor verifier program. We'll call this attribute "_scan_". So your anchor tag
could look like this:  
>
  `<a scan href="someurl.com">text</a>`

The reason for this "scan" attribute is that there could be certain anchor tags you do not want
to verify, and so by leaving out the "scan" attribute they will be bypassed.

>
[[ _How could you alter the program to find all anchor tags?_ ]]

When you run with the "__print__" option ancver will output request status codes
with descriptions in the console. Many status codes other than 200 will occur because 
of website security and the fact that our requests are not made from a browser! 
So these are assumed to be OK and they'll be printed out with the code and message.
Errors will appear in red for cases where there was no return code indicating a 
definite problem with the URL.

The "__try__" option is the same as the "print" option; however, URLs that do not return
a status code will also be opened in a separate tab in your default browser.

If you run the program with the "__open__" option, then each URL is opened in a 
separate tab in your default browser. Nothing is reported in the terminal.

__Running the program:__  

python3 ancver.py https://yourwebpage.xyz {print | open}

Here is a portion of the page being tested:  
```html
<body>
<h1>Hello Anchors</h1>
<a scan href="https://google.com">Google</a>
<a scan href="https://faceboo.com">Facebook</a>
<a scan href="https://amazon.com/customerx/">Amazon</a>
<a scan href="https://apple.com">Apple</a>
<a href="my.pdf">My PDF file</a>
<a scan href="https://microsoft.com/news">microsoft</a>
</body>

```

__Here is the output:__ 
```bash

$> python3 ancver.py https://somesite.com/test print

```
```bash
200
----------
https://google.com
301 Moved Permanently
----------
https://facebooky.com
request failed: invalid URL?, or try URL in browser.
----------
https://amazon.com/frodo/
301 Moved Permanently
----------
https://apple.com
301 Moved Permanently
----------
https://microsoft.com/news
301 Moved Permanently

Found 1 errors.
```
Not every error (red message) is always an error (but most are.) 
Therefore, it is always recomended to manually test the suspect URL in your
browser before correcting or deleting it.

__In Conclusion:__  
If you can find a way to include a '_scan_' attribute into your anchor/href tags, then,
with this program, you can save lots of time verifying the integrity of your website's links.

Also, you may want to dig deeper into both _BeautifulSoup_ and the _requests_ libraries.
They are powerful tools with many applications.
